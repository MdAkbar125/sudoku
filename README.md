## How It Works

1. The Sudoku board is generated dynamically using JavaScript.
2. Pre-filled cells are locked and cannot be edited.
3. User input is validated in real time to enforce Sudoku rules.
4. A timer starts when the game begins or is reset.
5. When the puzzle is solved correctly:
   - The timer stops
   - A congratulations modal appears
   - Completion time is displayed
